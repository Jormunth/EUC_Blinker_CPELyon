# IMU Solution  

**Author** : *Alix Deleule*

## System Description
The IMU-based system consists of three main components:
1. A central module (ESP32-WROOM microcontroller and MPU-6050 IMU).  
2. Two hand modules (each with an ESP32-WROOM microcontroller and an MPU-6050 IMU).  

Each hand module collects accelerometer and gyroscope data and analyse it for gesture recognition and send the recognized gesture via BLE to the central unit, which then controls the blinkers.

## Algorithms descriptions

### Hand gestures recognition - Peak detection
We use a buffer to store raw sensor data from the accelerometer and gyroscope over a set period. This allows us to process multiple readings together, helping to detect patterns and trends necessary for gesture recognition. The buffer ensures temporal consistency and efficient processing of the data.

We chose a window size of 52 because the MPU6050 sensor outputs data at 52 Hz, meaning it provides 52 samples per second. A 1-second window (52 samples) captures enough data to recognize all gestures, as post-processing analysis showed that gestures can be identified within this timeframe. This setup ensures accurate and efficient gesture recognition.

Below is the preprocessed data showing that the gestures can be recognized by making a peak detection of the filtered accelerometer norm in a 1second window.

![](data_processing/peak_detection/img/peak_detection_unknown.png)
![](data_processing/peak_detection/img/peak_detection_2_shake_left.png)

This last gesture shows that looking at the peaks of accel instead of gyro is more accurate as gyro detects peaks where there should not be any.

### Turn recognition - Peak detection

### BLE connections

### Battery monitoring

### LED strip


## Explored Alternatives

- MEMS Studio decision tree, not the correct sensor, used anyway but led to innaccurate results, however it was inspiring for the features that were analysed for the peak detection
 - Utilisation de MEMS Studio afin de generer un decision tree a partir des donnees IMU, FAILED algo fait main
mems studio features:
        "F1_MEAN_ACC_Z",
        "F2_MINIMUM_ACC_Z",
        "F3_VARIANCE_ACC_Y",
        "F4_MEAN_GYR_V",
        "F5_MAXIMUM_ACC_X",
        "F6_PEAK_TO_PEAK_ACC_Y",

        "F13_MINIMUM_ACC_V",
        "F14_MEAN_ACC_V",
        "F15_ENERGY_GYR_Y"
- raw IMU data streamed over BLE from both hand module to central module then substract central IMU data to keep only relative accel, then detect gesture from that
- simple led used for blinkers but that was for demo now strip led is better
